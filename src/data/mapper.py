    flipping the final image; it returns the image augmented in a default way along with its
    flipped version (for the CNS loss).

        Most of code comes from the original `__call__`. The only difference is the last few lines of code.
        There, the list of transforms is extended with an additional x-flip and its applied
        to the image. Note that it may happen that the resulting transforms list will have two x-flips
        (which is effectively no flip) and one may reason we could simply keep the original image untouched
        and flip its copy. However, we want to keep things as it is because only the original image (in the first
        dict) is used for the supervised training and the x-flipped image is used only for CNS loss. So if
        the original image would never get x-flipped, the model effectively will never be trained on x-flipped
